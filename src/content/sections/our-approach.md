We identify where nature is needed most. Using open data and community insights, we map the city’s challenges — from heat and flooding to air pollution and lack of green space — and reveal the places where small interventions can make the biggest impact. 

Through our tools, **Explorer** and **Sightings**, we highlight both the gaps and the existing grassroots efforts already shaping the city. By connecting with local organisations, builders and makers, we help turn strategic opportunities into real, on-the-ground microinterventions that bring nature back into the urban fabric.
